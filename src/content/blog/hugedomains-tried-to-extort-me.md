In the year of our Lord 2021, my card failed the auto-renewal transaction for my domain [andarms.com](https://andarms.com/). At that time, I didnâ€™t have the site active, but I had reserved the domain because at some point I wanted to create my personal brand under that name, andarms.

I didnâ€™t notice until a couple of months later, and to my surprise, [HugeDomains](https://www.hugedomains.com/) had bought the domain without using it â€” only to resell it for more than $3,000 USD. But they didnâ€™t count on my patience. For years I waited until they finally released the domain, and today in 2025 it finally happened.

Now I can build my personal brand. Screw [HugeDomains](https://www.hugedomains.com/) ðŸ–•.
