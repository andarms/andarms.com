Starting work on my untitled game engine project. The goal is to build a simple but flexible 2D game engine using C# and Raylib.

## Initial Setup

I've set up the basic project structure with:

- Entity Component System (ECS) architecture
- Basic sprite rendering
- Input handling
- Scene management

## Technical Stack

- **Language**: C#
- **Graphics**: Raylib
- **Architecture**: ECS pattern
- **Platform**: Cross-platform (Windows, Linux, macOS)

The ECS approach will make it easy to add new game systems and keep the code modular and maintainable.

## Next Steps

1. Implement collision detection
2. Add animation system
3. Create basic audio support
4. Build a simple test game

This is just the beginning of what I hope will be a fun learning experience in engine development.
