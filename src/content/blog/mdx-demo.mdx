MDX lets you write Markdown and use JSX syntax when you need it.

## A subheading

Here's some inline code: `console.log('hi')`.

And a fenced code block:

```ts
export function greet(name: string) {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}
```

> Tip: You can mix Markdown with components in MDX. Keep it simple to start.
